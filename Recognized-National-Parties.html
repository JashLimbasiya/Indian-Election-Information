            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)</span>&nbsp;</b>is one of two major&nbsp;political parties in India, along with the&nbsp;Indian National Congress.&nbsp;It is the current&nbsp;ruling political party&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Republic of India, having been so since 2014.&nbsp;The BJP is a&nbsp;right-wing&nbsp;party, and its policy has historically reflected&nbsp;Hindu nationalist&nbsp;positions.&nbsp;It has close ideological and organisational links to the much older&nbsp;Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh&nbsp;(RSS).&nbsp;As of 2019, it is the country's largest political party in terms of representation in the&nbsp;national parliament&nbsp;and state assemblies and is by far the&nbsp;world's largest party in terms of primary membership, with the second largest party, the&nbsp;Communist Party of China, having about half the registered members of the BJP.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The BJP's origin lies in the&nbsp;Bharatiya Jana Sangh, formed in 1951 by&nbsp;Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.&nbsp;After the&nbsp;State of Emergency&nbsp;in 1977, the Jana Sangh merged with several other parties to form the&nbsp;Janata Party; it defeated the incumbent Congress party in the&nbsp;1977 general election. After three years in power, the Janata party dissolved in 1980 with the members of the erstwhile Jana Sangh reconvening to form the BJP. Although initially unsuccessful, winning only two seats in the&nbsp;1984 general election, it grew in strength on the back of the&nbsp;Ram Janmabhoomi&nbsp;movement. Following victories in several state elections and better performances in national elections, the BJP became the largest party in the parliament in 1996; however, it lacked a majority in the lower house of Parliament, and its government lasted only 13 days.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After the&nbsp;1998 general election, the BJP-led coalition known as the&nbsp;National Democratic Alliance&nbsp;(NDA) under Prime Minister&nbsp;Atal Bihari Vajpayee&nbsp;formed a government that lasted for a year. Following fresh elections, the NDA government, again headed by Vajpayee, lasted for a full term in office; this was the first non-Congress government to do so. In the&nbsp;2004 general election, the NDA suffered an unexpected defeat, and for the next ten years the BJP was the principal opposition party. Long time&nbsp;Gujarat&nbsp;Chief Minister&nbsp;Narendra Modi&nbsp;led it to a landslide victory in the&nbsp;2014 general election. Since that election, Modi has led the NDA government as Prime Minister and as of February&nbsp;2019, the alliance governs 18 states.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The official ideology of the BJP is&nbsp;integral humanism, first formulated by&nbsp;Deendayal Upadhyaya&nbsp;in 1965. The party expresses a commitment to&nbsp;Hindutva, and its policy has historically reflected&nbsp;Hindu nationalist&nbsp;positions. The BJP advocates&nbsp;social conservatism&nbsp;and a foreign policy centred on nationalist principles. Its key issues have included the abrogation of the&nbsp;special status to Jammu and Kashmir, the building of a&nbsp;Ram Temple&nbsp;in&nbsp;Ayodhya&nbsp;and the implementation of a&nbsp;uniform civil code. However, the 1998–2004 NDA government did not pursue any of these controversial issues. It instead focused on a largely&nbsp;liberal&nbsp;economic policy prioritising&nbsp;globalisation&nbsp;and&nbsp;economic growth&nbsp;over social&nbsp;welfare.<br>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Indian National Congress</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 400;"> (INC)&nbsp;</span></b>is one of the two major&nbsp;political parties in India, along with its main rival the&nbsp;Bharatiya Janata Party.&nbsp;The Congress is a "big tent" party whose platform is generally considered in the&nbsp;centre&nbsp;in its ideological orientation, of&nbsp;Indian politics.&nbsp;On social issues, it advocates secular policies that encourage&nbsp;equal opportunity,&nbsp;right to health,&nbsp;civil liberty&nbsp;and welfare of weaker sections and minorities, with support for a mixed economy.&nbsp;As of 2021, in the 17&nbsp;general elections&nbsp;since independence, it has won an outright majority on seven occasions and has led the ruling coalition a further three times, heading the central government for more than 54 years. There have been six Congress&nbsp;Prime Ministers, the first being&nbsp;Jawaharlal Nehru&nbsp;(1947–1964), and the most recent&nbsp;Manmohan Singh&nbsp;(2004–2014).<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Founded on December 28, 1885 in Bombay, Congress was an assembly for politically-minded individuals who were interested in reforms. In its first twenty years, known as a 'moderate phase', Congress was not interested in campaigning for independence or self-rule but for greater political autonomy within&nbsp;British Raj.&nbsp;From the late 19th century, and especially after 1920, under the leadership of&nbsp;Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became more vocal and active in demanding substantial political reform, and eventually turned out to be the principal leader of the&nbsp;Indian independence movement.&nbsp;Congress led India to independence from the&nbsp;United Kingdom, and powerfully influenced other&nbsp;anti-colonial nationalist movements&nbsp;in the&nbsp;British Empire.&nbsp;It was the first modern&nbsp;nationalist movement&nbsp;to emerge in the British Empire in Asia and Africa.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A split occurred within the Congress party in 1969. Indira Gandhi in order to demonstrate her support amongst the people, created her own faction, the&nbsp;Congress (R); while the other group was the&nbsp;Congress (O). In the&nbsp;1971 general election, Congress (R) had secured an overwhelming majority winning 352 out of 518 seats in the&nbsp;Lok Sabha. In the elections to five state assemblies too, the Congress (R) performed well. However,&nbsp;1977 general election&nbsp;resulted in a heavy defeat for the Congress (R). Indira Gandhi left the Congress (R) in 1978, to form her own&nbsp;Congress (I)&nbsp;faction which eventually was declared the rightful Indian National Congress by the Indian election commission in 1981.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Congress party won the&nbsp;2004 general elections&nbsp;and returned to power after a record eight years out of office. The Congress-led coalition known as the&nbsp;United Progressive Alliance&nbsp;(UPA) under Prime Minister Manmohan Singh formed a government. Subsequently, the UPA again formed the government after winning&nbsp;2009 general elections&nbsp;with strong result in Kerala,&nbsp;Maharashtra, Rajasthan,&nbsp;Tamil Nadu,&nbsp;Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Singh became the first Prime Minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962 to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term. However, in the&nbsp;2014 general election, UPA suffered heavy defeat winning only 55 seats of the 543-member&nbsp;Lok Sabha&nbsp;(the&nbsp;lower house&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Parliament of India). As of June&nbsp;2021, the party with its alliances is in power in six legislative assemblies.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A total of 61 people have served as the president of the INC since its formation.&nbsp;Sonia Gandhi&nbsp;is the longest serving president of the party, having held the office for over twenty years from 1998 to 2017 and since 2019. The district party is the smallest functional unit of the Congress. There is also a&nbsp;Pradesh Congress Committee&nbsp;(PCC), present at the state-level in every&nbsp;state. Together, the delegates from the districts and PCCs form the&nbsp;All India Congress Committee&nbsp;(AICC). The party is also organized into several committees, and sections.

        <p class="u-large-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-7"> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The NCP was formed on 25 May 1999, by&nbsp;Sharad Pawar,&nbsp;P. A. Sangma, and&nbsp;Tariq Anwar&nbsp;after they were expelled from the&nbsp;Indian National Congress&nbsp;(INC) on 20 May 1999, for disputing the right of&nbsp;Italian-born&nbsp;Sonia Gandhi&nbsp;to lead the party.&nbsp;At the time of formation of the NCP, the&nbsp;Indian Congress (Socialist)&nbsp;party merged with the new party.<br>Despite the NCP being founded on opposition to the leadership of Sonia Gandhi, the party joined the Congress led&nbsp;UPA&nbsp;to form&nbsp;government of Maharashtra&nbsp;in October 1999. In 2004, the party joined the UPA to form the Indian Government led by&nbsp;Manmohan Singh. NCP leader, Sharad Pawar served as the&nbsp;Minister of Agriculture&nbsp;for both five-year terms of Singh led government. The party remained part of the Congress led Maharashtra state government until 2014.&nbsp;On 20 June 2012,&nbsp;P. A. Sangma&nbsp;quit the NCP to contest in&nbsp;presidential polls.&nbsp;In May 2014 Lok Sabha, the UPA lost to the rival NDA alliance led by&nbsp;Narendra Modi&nbsp;and the NCP was out of government for the first time in ten years. NCP broke its alliance with the Congress party just before Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections in 2014 to contest on its own.&nbsp;In the assembly election the BJP emerged as the largest party and formed a minority government initially with support from NCP.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In April 2019, voting took place for the 48&nbsp;Lok Sabha&nbsp;seats from Maharashtra. The Congress and NCP had a seat-sharing arrangement.&nbsp;Similarly, despite their differences, the BJP and Shiv Sena once again contested the elections together under the&nbsp;National Democratic Alliance&nbsp;(NDA) banner.&nbsp;The election was another landslide victory for the NDA, with the BJP and Shiv Sena winning 23 and 18 seats, respectively, out of the total of the state's 48 Lok Sabha seats. The Congress party won only one seat in the state whereas the NCP won five seats from its stronghold of western Maharashtra.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In November 2019 after a month of political drama, the NCP came back into power at the state level as part of a coalition formed between Shiv Sena, the Congress and NCP. This followed the&nbsp;Vidhan sabha elections&nbsp;in October 2019 where the BJP–Shiv-Sena and NCP–Congress alliances remained intact for seat sharing. The BJP and Shiv Sena together gained the majority of seats in the assembly but could not form government due to squabbles between the two parties. The BJP, with 105 seats, was far short of the 145 seats required to form majority and declined to form a minority government. At the same time, Shiv Sena started talks with the NCP and Congress to form government. However, in a dramatic and controversial move, on 23 November 2019, the BJP formed a government with support from NCP, with&nbsp;Ajit Pawar&nbsp;as Deputy Chief Minister. This government collapsed three days later with Chief Minister&nbsp;Devendra Fadnavis&nbsp;and Ajit Pawar resigning their respective positions. On 28 November 2019, the governor of Maharashtra swore in&nbsp;Uddhav Thackeray, the Shiv Sena chief, as the new chief minister of Maharashtra. Thackeray's governing coalition includes Shiv Sena, NCP, INC, and a number of independent members of legislative assembly. The cabinet includes ministers from NCP in key portfolios.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Mumbai President of the Nationalist Congress Party&nbsp;Nawab Malik&nbsp;said that the NCP advocates for&nbsp;Indian reunification, that "India, Pakistan and Bangladesh should be merged". Malik compared this to&nbsp;German reunification: "If the Berlin wall can be demolished then why not India, Pakistan and Bangladesh come together?"<br>
